The goal of appsilonRShinyTaskAarshBatra is to visualize the marine
dataset to figure out the max distance travelled by a ship beween two
consecutive points given all of its trips.

## App

-   Version one of the app is online. Click
    [here](https://aarsh.shinyapps.io/appsilonRShinyTaskAarshBatra/) to
    view the app. I will upload the final version of the app by end of
    Feb 7, 2021.

-   To view underlying app code, look into the **app.R** file.

## Code

-   All of the functions used to make distance calculations can be found
    in the **shinyTaskMasterScript.R** file. This file is present in the
    R sub-directory

-   Documentation for all of the functions can be found in the **man**
    folder

-   Note: Although I have used **roxygen2** package for commenting for
    all code files. This repository is not a R package. There is some
    more work that will go into this before this becomes a R package. I
    will work on that after submitting this task.

## Data

-   Raw marine data zip file that is used for all calculations is
    contained in the **data-raw** directory.
